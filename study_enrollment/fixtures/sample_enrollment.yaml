      reveal a lot about you.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you reporting a preference \"jimmies\"
      as a topping (instead of \"sprinkles\"), you would reveal that you probably
      grew up in the Boston area.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you state a preference
      for \"garlic\" ice cream people might suspect you've visited Gilroy, CA. (They
      might also think you are a bit weird.)\r\n\r\nYour answers will be publicly
      shared. We will NOT have anyone review this data before it is publicly shared.
